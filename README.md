Workforce Stability Dashboard
Analyzing employee turnover and stability based on marital status, gender, and age.

## Overview
This project features a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize workforce stability within an organization. The primary objective is to identify key trends and patterns in employee retention and turnover by segmenting the data by marital status, gender, and age. This analysis provides actionable insights for Human Resources and management to develop targeted strategies for improving employee satisfaction and reducing voluntary turnover.

## Data Source
The dataset for this dashboard was obtained from Kaggle.com https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset. The data was processed and cleaned using Microsoft Excel, Power Query, which involved several key steps:

Initial data profiling and cleansing to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

Transformation of data types to ensure proper formatting for analysis.

Creation of custom columns to categorize employees into distinct age groups for more granular analysis.

## Key Insights
The dashboard provides a visual representation of several key insights, including:

Age and Turnover: Turnover rates are highest among employees in the 20-29 age bracket, indicating a potential need for stronger retention programs for early-career hires.

Gender Differences: The data suggests slight variations in retention rates between male and female employees, particularly within certain departments and age ranges.

Marital Status Impact: The analysis reveals that single employees have a higher turnover rate, .
